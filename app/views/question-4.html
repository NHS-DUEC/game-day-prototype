            A nurse needs to speak to you so we can get you the right help. When you book a call the nurse will:
          </p>

          <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
            <li>know what you've answered so far</li>
            <li>advise you what to do next</li>
            <li>book an appointment for you if you need one</li>
          </ul>

          <p>If you don't book a call and just ring 111 you will have to start again from the beginning.</p>
